## A little about me

Hi there! My name is Zhu Yongzhe (Kevin) and I am a rising junior at University of Pennsylvania, Computer and Information Science department by Fall 2021.

### Places that mean a lot to me

- Nanjing, my hometown. Cultivated my taste in both food and music.
- Yangzhou, where I spend many summers with my family.
- Philadelphia. Sweet home New College House. And all the cheesesteaks.
- Praha (Prague), still roams the spirit of 5.
